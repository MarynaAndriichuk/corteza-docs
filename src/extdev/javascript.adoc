== About async/await and Promises
If you are not familiar with Promises, we strogly recommend reading MDN article
{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises about using promises}

  In short: Promises solve problem of asynchronous code and remove the need for cumbersome
  callbacks via function parameters. They provide a simple and readable syntax and error
  handling via .catch().

== About use of await/async syntactic sugar

  You will find examples with await prefix. You can not use this on the global scope of the script, it will
  result in "await is only valid in async function syntax error".

You can, however wrap your code with `(async () => { ... }())` and place your await calls there.</p>

== The arrow function expression (=>)
MDN article {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions about arrow functions}
