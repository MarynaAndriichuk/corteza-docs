= {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_FEDERATION}

{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_FEDERATION} enables different *{PRODUCT_NAME} instances* to establish a *federated network* to *freely and securely* exchange information.

A federated network consists of *origin* and *destination* nodes, where each node can fulfil both roles.
Take a look at the xref:ROOT:developer-guide/federation/glossary.adoc[glossary] for a reference on our terminology.

.The diagram provides an abstract overview of the entire {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_FEDERATION} system. It consists of three major parts -- node pairing (the nodes establish a federated network), structure syncing (the nodes agree on what will be shared), and data syncing (the destination node accesses the data on the origin node).

== Node pairing ==
NodeA <-> NodeB: Pair nodes.
note over NodeA, NodeB: The two nodes are identified and exchange authentication credentials via a node handshake.
...
== Structure syncing ==
NodeA -> NodeA: Expose structures.
note over NodeA
The origin node determines what structures
it wishes to expose to the destination node.
end note
NodeA -> NodeB: Structure sync

NodeB -> NodeB: Module mapping.
note over NodeB
The destination node determines what fields
from the origin structure it wishes to consume.
The destination node also specifies where
the data should be stored (field mapping).

== Data syncing ==
NodeA -> NodeB: Data sync.

== Glossary

We recommend you firstly go over xref:ROOT:developer-guide/federation/glossary.adoc[*the glossary*] so you will understand our terminology.

== Security & logging

xref:ROOT:developer-guide/federation/security-logging.adoc[*The security & logging*] goes over the *RBAC access control* integration, and the *action log logging* integration.

== Node pairing

xref:ROOT:developer-guide/federation/node-pair.adoc[*Node pairing*] is the process of *establishing a federated network* between two {PRODUCT_NAME} instances (nodes).

{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_FEDERATION} defines a *node pairing handshake* which enables two nodes to securely exchange authentication credentials.

== Node syncing

xref:ROOT:developer-guide/federation/node-sync.adoc[*Node syncing*] is the process of determining *what data should be shared* and the *actual data sharing*.

.Node syncing consists of two parts:
* xref:ROOT:developer-guide/federation/node-sync.adoc#structure-sync[*structure sync*]: determines what data should be shared,
* xref:ROOT:developer-guide/federation/node-sync.adoc#data-sync[*data sync*]: syncs the data between the two nodes.

== API reference

xref:ROOT:developer-guide/federation/api/index.adoc[*The API reference*] provides a complete list of *available API endpoints with working cURL examples*.

// Node pairing::
//     The process of establishing a federated network between two nodes.
//     After they are paired, they are able to securely exchange data.
//     Refer to <<federation:node-pair>> and <<federation:security:authentication>> for details.

// Structure syncing::
//     The process of determining what structures on the origin node (the one that contains the data), is exposed to it's destination node (the one that wishes to access the data).
//     The origin node has full control over what data the destination node is allowed to access.
//     This can be as simple as allowing access to only specific modules; and as complex as allowing access to only specific module fields.
//     Refer to <<federation:structure-sync>> and <<federation:security:access-control>> for details.

// Data syncing::
//     The process of updating data on the destination node, based on the updated data source.
//     The destination node has the ability to determine what field from the origin node maps into what field in the destination node.
//     Refer to <<federation:data-sync>> for details.
