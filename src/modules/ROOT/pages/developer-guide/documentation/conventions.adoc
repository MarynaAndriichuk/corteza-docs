= Conventions

You can use all of the formatting and different components that AsciiDoc allows.
We do define some exceptions for better consistency when working with more flexible components.
The conventions listed bellow must be followed when contributing to any part of the documentation.

== Lists

Ordered lists::
  Ordered lists should be defined with the `.` instead of using actual numbers.
  For example:

[source,adoc]
----
. List point 1,
. list point 2.
----

Unordered lists::
  Unordered lists should be defined with the `*`.
  For example:

[source,adoc]
----
* List point 1,
* list point 2.
----

== Code snippets

Short one-liners::
    When specifying short code snippets such as a CLI command use the single backtick (```),

Longer code snippets::
    Try to avoid long code snippets as much as possible unless when working on examples.
    Use the source code syntax `[source,{language here}]` blocked 4 dashes `----`.
    For example:

// Here, this one is an exception though
```
[source,adoc]
----
----
```

== Admonition

Use the admonition block syntax when wanting to create admonitions.
For example:

[source,adoc]
----
[{VARIANT}]
====
// Content goes here.
====
----
