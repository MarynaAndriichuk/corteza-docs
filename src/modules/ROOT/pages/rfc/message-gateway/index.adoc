= Message gateway

Message gateway is a service that can manage, influence, reroute, capture and forward incoming and outgoing messages sent from {product_name}.

It supports multiple message types (email, sms, ...) and providers.

Administrator can configure quotas, routing and logging rules:

 - enable max messages / day for a user
 - disable all email output for all users
 - allow email forwarding only for a particular set of users (or email pattern)
 - delay messages delivery until certain time intervals (send emails only during working hours)
 - should handle message-send/message-received triggers transparently
