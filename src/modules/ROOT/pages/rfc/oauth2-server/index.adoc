= OAuth2 Server

== Supported grant types and protocols:

 - Authorization Code Grant with PKCE extension; for browser apps
 - Client Credentials; for machine-to-machine use
 - Refresh Token

== Tokens

Hashed value of JSON Web Token is kept in credentials store to support token revocation (logout, RFC 7009).

== Preinstalled clients

 - {PRODUCT_NAME} Web applications
 - {APP_AUTOMATION}
 - Sink #TBD#

=== Client features, options, flags:

.Each client can have/be:
 - enabled/disabled,
 - shortlist of roles (see below)

=== Key-Secret pairs

Client can have multiple key-secret pairs.

.Each pair can have/be:
 - enabled/disabled,
 - validity date range,
 - grant type
 - one or more IP ranges (when applicable)

Key-secret properties are immutable (exception: enabled/disabled flag).

=== Role shortlisting

Each client must have explicitly defined list of roles.
When successfully authenticated, intersection of user's and client roles is used to create a subgroup of roles.
This subgroup is then used in security descriptor for that session.
