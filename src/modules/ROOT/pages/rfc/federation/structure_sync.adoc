[#structure-syncing]
= Syncing structures

The process of determining what structures on the origin node, is exposed to it's destination node.
The origin node has full control over what data the destination node is allowed to access.
This can be as simple as allowing access to only specific modules; and as complex as allowing access to only specific module fields.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The two nodes must be paired prior to this.
See <<rfc:federation:node-pair, Node pairing>>.
====

== Exposing structures

Firstly, in order to perform any data sharing, the origin node must define what structures (in our case modules and fields) the destination node can access.
This can be performed via the Corteza Low-Code administration panel, or directly via the API.

[NOTE]
====
Besides the module itself, the origin node must also specify what fields the destination node is allowed to access.

=== API

==== Expose module

==== See exposed module

include::api/structure_sync__list_exposed_module.adoc[]

==== Remove exposed module

==== Change exposed module fields

== Syncing structures

When the two nodes are paired and the origin node has exposed some structures, the actual structure sync can occur.

Destination node requests changed structures::
    Origin node provides a set of endpoints that the destination node can use to fetch shared structures.

include::api/structure_sync__master_changes.adoc[]

Destination node fetches updated structures::
    The destination node requests structure definitions based on the above provided set of endpoints.
    The origin node provides the structure definition with respect to the fields that the destination node is allowed to access.

include::api/structure_sync__sync_shared_module.adoc[]

Destination node updates its store::
    Once the structure sync is finished, the destination node writes the structures to the store and updates the nodes status.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This step doesn't create any system resources, such as records, on the destination node.
This is performed later in the data sync.

[#rfc:federation:structure-sync:field-mapping]
== Field mapping

Field mapping allows the destination node to determine what fields from the origin node should map into what fields on the destination node.
This allows some flexibility when it comes down to datamodel definitions on both origin and destination nodes.
This can be performed via the Corteza Low-Code administration panel, or directly via the API.

=== API

==== Set field mapping for a module
include::api/structure_sync__set_module_federation_mapping.adoc[]

==== Get field mapping for a module
include::api/structure_sync__get_module_federation_mapping.adoc[]

==== Remove field mapping for a module
include::api/structure_sync__remove_module_federation_mapping.adoc[]

=== Store

==== Module mapping

include::store/module_mapping.adoc[]

== Example

=== Phase I - on Origin node

First phase is exposing the desired modules for a specific node (to the Destination), so the structure mapping on the Destination and then the data sync can be done.

|===

=== Phase II - on Destination node

There are 2 phases in the phase II. First the module info from Origin is saved. After that we can do the mapping. The modules on the Destination need to be created beforehand.

*compose_module*
|===
|id|handle|name

|261250629010849755|Account_federated|Account (federated from Origin)
|===

*compose_module_field*

| 161250629061509121 | String | Mobile      | Mobile               |        0
| 161250629044666369 | String | Desc        | Description          |        0
|===

*federation_node*
|===
|id|name

|1|Our server
|2|Misc server (some other server)
|3|Origin server in this example (from phase I)
|===

==== 1. Fetch and save the module info

*federation_module_shared*

|===
|id|handle|name|rel_node|xref_module|field_mapping

|22|Account|Account|3|11|[{"name":"Phone","kind":"String","is_multi":0}]
|===

==== 2. Mapping finished, modules created

The sharing of modules info from Origin is added, that is enough information for us to handle mapping from UI. We can now pick the fields from the field_mapping column that we need and store it into the mapping table.

*federation_module_mapping*
