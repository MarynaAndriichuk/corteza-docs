= SMTP configuration checking

To verify your setup and values in `SMTP_*` variables, you can use the following command:

[source,shell]
----
corteza-server auth test-notifications your-email@example.tld
----

This will send authentication emails (like password-reset) to the given email address.

Sometimes you'll see the connection or authentication issues right away:
----
could not send email: dial tcp [::1]:25: connect: connection refused
----

If your setup is valid and email sending was successful, you'll receive an email to your inbox (or the inbox of the given recipient).
