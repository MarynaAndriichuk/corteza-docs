== Create a new user

To create a new user click on "New" button on top right corner above the User list.

Fulfill the Basic information and hit submit.
You can set a user a password to log in (but he'll need to confirm his email after the first attempt to log in).
Alternatively, a user can request a "Forgotten password" on login screen and set a password on his own.

== Edit a user

To edit a user click on an "Edit" icon on the right side of the users list.

In this screen you can:

- Change user's basic information (email, full name, handle)
- Delete or suspend a user
- Set a user a new password
- Add a user to a certain role
