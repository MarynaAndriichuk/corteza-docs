= Modules
    
Exposed and shared modules specify the structure of the federated data.

== Exposed modules

These keep the information on the originating node (in term of data flow - destination node can also have exposed modules) about the fields of a specific node that is to be shared to other node (these settings are node-specific). You can look at it as in terms of whitelisting the data that can be served to another node.

== Shared modules

These modules specify the structure of the data on the destination node once the structure synchronisation is done. This is a representation of the exposed module, but on the destination node.

[NOTE]
====
Shared modules are only created via structure synchronisation and cannot be removed or updated in administration.
