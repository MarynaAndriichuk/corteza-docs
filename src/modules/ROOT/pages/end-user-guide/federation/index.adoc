[#federation]
= {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_FEDERATION}

{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_MESSAGING} aims to connect different Corteza instances into a federated network, where they can freely exchange information.

This documentation provides information to the administrator of the federated servers (nodes), facilitating an easier work with setting up the structure to be synced and working with users in access control area (roles).

.Quick access:
 - <<federation:node:pair,I need to add a new node>>
 - <<federation:module:expose,I need to specify which fields will be federated to other nodes>>
 - <<federation:module:map,I need to connect federated fields from outside node to mine>>

.The main federation structures to hold information in Corteza are:
 - Nodes,
 - Modules (shared / exposed).
