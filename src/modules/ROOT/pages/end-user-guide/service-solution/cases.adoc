= Cases

The main module of Service Solution is cases: the place where the customer's issues are captured and handled.
Each case has an automatically generated case number, which starts with "ticket#" followed by the date-time.
An example case number is: ticket#20191025094353420 (the date can be read as: 2019-10-25 09:43:53:420).

The case subject is used in list throughout the application, so it needs to be short and clear.

On the left, the block "Case Description" contains the status, category, a long description, the priority, related product and, if closed, the solition and close date.
On the right, the block "Case Details" contain data about who owns the case, the source and the total time and cost.
At the bottom, there are areas for related attachments and the knowledge base, which allows you to quickly find related knowledge base items.

At the center of the page is the "Updates" block.
Each update on the case is added to this list, giving a clear overview of each action related to the case.
Actions such as calls or emails can be inserted by clicking on the "Add update to this case" button, while the status change updates are recorded automatically upon changing the status of the case.

.The tipical flow for using this module is:
1. A call/email from a client comes in. The client as an issue.
2. The service agent checks the account of the client and sees in the entitlements if the client is entitled to support
3. If the client is entitled to support, a new case is created, directly from the account page.
4. The sales agent inserts the subject, description and priority, and optionally selects the category (which is "Problem" by default), related product and contact. Other fields, such as the case number and status, are inserted automatically.
+
The case owner is, by default, the person that creates the case.
+
If this needs to be someone else, the case creator can simple select the correct agent there.
5. After that, the agent that has the case assigned can work on the case, contact the client, insert updates, etc.
