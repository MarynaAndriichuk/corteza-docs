= Entitlements

Entitlements are types of customer support, such as “Phone support” or “Email support”.
You can set up entitlements in Service Solution to help support agents determine whether a customer is eligible for support or not.

Entitlements are always related to an account and a product, and they normally have a start and end date.
For example: company Green Global has acquired a software license and this entitles them to receive phone support for one year.

To facilitate the use of this module, multiple values are inserted automatically, thanks to the option of selecting an entitlement template for a product.
