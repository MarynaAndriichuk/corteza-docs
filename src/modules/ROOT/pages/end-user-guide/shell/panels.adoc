Panels allows you to split your screen into a maximum of 4 sub panels.
To open a new panel, click on the “4 Square” icon on the top right corner of your screen.

After a click on the "4 Square" icon, you'll access a right sidebar when you can define where you would like to open your next application.

.Use cases:
- By default, the first application is open in the 1st Row and in the 1st Column (Row 1 Column 1)
- If you decide to split your screen vertically, you will mark additional checkbox in Row 1 Column 2.
- If you decide to split your screen horizontally, you will mark additional checkbox in Row 2 Column 1.

== Slider

When you have at least two panels enabled, you'Ll notice a Slider which is a yellow toggle at the cross-section of open the open Panels.
The Slider allows a user to dynamically resize the relationship between open Panels to suit the users visual and practical requirements.
