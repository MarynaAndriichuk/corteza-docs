= Entitlement templates

A product or service normally comes with a entitlement to support.
For example, a software license may allow the client to contact you by phone when they have issues or questions.
Or, when you sell hardware, you may need to offer a period of guarantee, allowing the client to contact you when the product breaks within that period.

For most products and services the entitlements will be the same, so that's why Service Cloud offers a templates module.
After creating an entitlement template, you can select it in a product.
Then, when a customer acquires that product, the template will be used to prefill data such at type of entitlement and end date.
