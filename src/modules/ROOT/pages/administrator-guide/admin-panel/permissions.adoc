= Permissions

The *permissions* interface allows you to configure *core system-level permissions*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There is a separate view for <<permissions-system,*system*>>, <<permissions-messaging,*{APP_NAME_MESSAGING}*>>, and <<permissions-compose,*{APP_NAME_COMPOSE}*>>.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
These rules also *apply to automation scripts*.
If a user is *not allowed to access* {APP_NAME_COMPOSE}, the triggered *automation script* is also *prevented access*.
