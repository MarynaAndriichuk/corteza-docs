= Corredor helpers

*Corredor helpers* implement the most common automation script operations, such as *creating new records*, *registering users*, and *sending emails*.
They are provided in the *execution context* (here: `exec(args, ctx)` -- see <<script-execution>>).

Corredor helpers are *context-aware*, meaning that they can automatically determine some arguments.
For example; when creating a record, Corredor helpers will know what *namespace*, *module*, and *record* you are using.
