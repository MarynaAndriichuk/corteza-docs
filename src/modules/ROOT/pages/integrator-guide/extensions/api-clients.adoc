= API clients

API clients simplify the process of accessing information stored inside {PRODUCT_NAME} via the API.
API clients can be found in the https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-js/tree/develop/src/api-clients[GitHub corteza-js repository].

When writing automation scripts, these API clients are automatically provided via the execution context.

[IMPORTANT]
====
These API clients greatly simplify the code so you should *always* use these instead of writing your own.
