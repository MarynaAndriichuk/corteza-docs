= Server scripts

Automation scripts allow you to implement custom business logic that is required for your needs.
*Server scripts* are executed in the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_AUTOMATION}.
Refer to xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/extensions/index.adoc[integrator guide/extensions] for more details.

[NOTE]
====
Since they are executed on the server, you can't manipulate the user interface.
Use *client scripts* if this is needed.
