= Style guide and best practices

== Style guide

{PRODUCT_NAME} workflows are loosely based on the BPMN 2.0 notation, therefore the style guides of BPMN 2.0 should be respected.
If you haven't heard of BPMN before, we suggest you research the notation so you can easily transition that to {PRODUCT_NAME} workflows.

There are some general rules when it comes to modeling workflows.

=== Keep it simple
Usually, the simplest solution is also the best, so the same principle can be applied here.

For example, instead of using a gateway to check a value and assign a different expression for each, you can just write the proper expression that does the same.

Option 1

Option 2

Both workflows produce the same result but one uses more steps than the other.
Therefore if something can be done with fewer steps that is usually the better way.

=== Avoid crossing connectors
To make the workflow more readable to other people and yourself, you should avoid having connectors that cross over each other.
This can confuse people unnecessarily.

=== Step labels
Every workflow step should have a label if possible. This will improve the readability of the workflow.
Labels should be as short as possible, to quickly convey the point across to the user observing the workflow.

Triggers should have the resource and trigger type in their label to easily determine when they are triggered, without looking at the trigger configuration.

Gateways should be labeled as a question. The outbound paths should be labeled as possible answers to the question.

Function label should contain the verb and the subject of the function.

=== Readable layouts
The layout of a workflow is better if a user can understand it more easily.

.Here are some tips:
* Flow should go from left to right, top to bottom,
* Related steps should be grouped,
* Align steps with grid, it is there for a reason,
* Symmetric layouts are generally easier to understand.

== Best practices

=== Define as many trigger constraints as sanity allows

When you click on the configuration icon image:workflow/cog.svg[width=20px] in the header of the trigger, you see that it is possible to define multiple trigger constraints.

When defining a "loose trigger" you can run into a situation where some events may trigger the workflow even though they shouldn't.

An example of this is the case module in our CRM and in our Service Solution.

.Defining a trigger with these constraints:
image:workflow/bp-constraints-no.png[]

If the case was created in the CRM or in the Service Solution, it causes the workflow to execute regardless.

To fix this edge-case, we can define an extra constraint that checks the namespace:

image:workflow/bp-constraints-yes.png[]

=== One expression step may have multiple expressions

When you click on the configuration icon image:workflow/cog.svg[width=20px] in the header of the expression step, you see that you can add multiple expressions.

Use this to reduce the number of expression steps, but don't go overboard.
If you wish to change the values of a contact and an account record, define only two expression steps where each focuses only on one record.

.An overengineered workflow example:

The above could easily be rewritten into the below form.

=== Most iterators are able to load and process data

xref:workflows/index.adoc#iterator-kind-item[Item iterators] that work with system resources (e.g. {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} records, system users and roles) can both fetch and process the data.

When you need to iterate over external resources (for example, social media posts), you need to fetch those beforehand.

=== Use handles whenever possible

Most resources allow you to define a human-friendly identifier next to the system generated identifier (a handle or a slug in case of a namespace).

These identifiers make it easier to write workflows that will work across different instances where the identifier may not be the same.
Readability is also increased; it's easier to read `lead` as an identifier to the lead module instead of `12897612987021`.
