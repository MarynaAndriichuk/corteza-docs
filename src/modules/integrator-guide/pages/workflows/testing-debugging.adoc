= Testing and debugging workflows

[#testing]
== Testing

Testing is a powerful and essential component of any project.

At the moment, our workflows don't implement any sophisticated testing framework and it must be done manually.
You can expect a powerful and flexible testing facility in the near future.

Lets look at an example.
We want to implement a workflow that calculates the cost of a newly created lead.
The cost of the lead is sent as an email to the administrator.

To simplify testing, we can use the manual workflow trigger.

[NOTE]
====
Note that when you run the workflow directly from the workflow editor, the initial scope is not defined.
If your workflow relies on any data from the initial scope, you need to fetch it manually.
====

Keeping the above note in mind, your workflow should look something like this:

To manually run the workflow, click on the settings icon image:workflow/cog.svg[width=20px] of the manual trigger and navigate to the bottom of the step configurator.

When you manually run the workflow, you will see a green outline that indicates the path of the execution based on the provided input.
If any of the steps fail to successfully execute, they will be marked with a red outline.
If there is no error handling, the manual execution will also terminate.

.Example of a successful test:

.Example of a failed test:

In some cases, your workflows may implement steps that should only run in production, such as client charging, mass email notifications and similar.
We can mock this path of execution by defining a `testing` flag at the start.
Before we reach the "in production only" steps, we use an exclusive gateway to do some special handling, such as logging a message or using a <<debug-step,debug step image:workflow/debug.svg[width=20px]>>.

Now when we run the workflow, we should see something like this:

== Debugging

Knowing how to debug a specific tool or software, can save a lot of time if you encounter an issue.

[#debug-step]
=== Debug step

The debug step image:workflow/debug.svg[width=20px] allows you to inspect the contents of the scope it resides in.
The debug step uses the logger configured by the server and is not visible in the workflow editor itself.

.A simple example:
image:workflow/debug-example-simple.png[]

=== Test run context

When you <<testing,run a manual test>> for the workflow you might notice an icon in the bottom right corner of the step.

image:workflow/debug-stepctx.png[]

When you hover over the icon you will see the important information regarding the steps' execution.

If you hover over a successful step (step with a green outline), you will see the execution time.
Knowing the execution time can help you pinpoint any system bottlenecks.

If you hover over a failed step (step with a red outline), you will see the execution time and the encountered error.
