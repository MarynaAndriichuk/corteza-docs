An automation script (script) is a piece of code that lets you implement custom business logic.
Automation scripts are written in plain JavaScript with support for node packages.

Take a look at oru samples (menu:Integrator Guide[Automation scripts,Samples]) and <<sample-project,sample project>> to get started faster.

[TIP]
====
See if you can implement your logic using xref:workflows/index.adoc[].
====

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote*: should the below thing be in a new section?
I think it would make sense to have here.
====

There are two categories of automation scripts -- *server scripts* and *client scripts*.

[cols="1a,5a"]
|===
| [#automation-scripts-server]#<<automation-scripts-server,Server scripts>>#
| These are executed in the *{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_AUTOMATION} server*.

.Use server scripts when:
* working with *sensitive data*,
* communicating with *external APIs*,
* they *shouldn't be interruptible* by the user.

.Example use cases:
* *create additional records* based on the current data,
* *send email* notifications,
* run *statistic analysis*.

| [#automation-scripts-client]#<<automation-scripts-client,Client scripts>>#
| These are executed in the client's browser (user agent, if you will).

.Use client scripts when:
* we need to *interact with the user*,
* we are performing *data validation*,
* *inserting* default *values*.

.Example use cases:
* *prompt the user* to confirm the form submission,
* *validate the form* submitted by the user,
* *redirect the user* after they've submitted the form,
* open an external webpage.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Client scripts are less secure as they run by the mercy of a user.
Any baked-in credentials are easily accessible, the execution is easily terminated.
====
|===

Which one should I use?
If we need to interact with the user (show notification, request confirmations), use *client scripts*.
Else, use *server scripts*.

== File structure

To start writing automation scripts, you must firstly define the appropriate file structure.

.The three main bits:
. `package.json` defines some metadata aswell as your dependencies.
. `/server-scripts` contains a set of automation scripts that will be executed on the {APP_AUTOMATION} server.
. `/client-scripts` contains a set of automation scripts that will be executed inside the web application.

Both `/server-scripts` and `/client-scripts` assume that all underlying files are automation scripts with valid signatures.
If you're defining a file with utility functions, move it under `/shared` or define a `/util` (or similar) at the root of the project.

The `/client-scripts` directory is a little special.
In order for client-scripts to work properly with node packages, we need to process them using forbidden pages from the webdev grimoire.

Each sub-directory inside `/client-scripts` defines a bundle.
When a web application loads, it fetches the bundle that is assigned to it (this is done automagically).Z

.An example filestructure containing all of the available bits:
[source,text]
----
package.json
...
/server-scripts
  ...
/client-scripts
  /auth
      ...
  /admin
      ...
  /compose 
      ...
  /messaging
      ...
  /shared
      ...
----

`...` indicates that you are free to structure your files as you see fit.
We do recommend you group your automation scripts based on their context.
For example, scripts working with Leads should go under the `/Lead` directory.

`/auth`, `/admin`, `/compose`, and `/messaging` contain scripts specific to each web application (this is the thing we talked about a bit earlier).

`/shared` contains code that client scripts can reuse.

== Script signature

[IMPORTANT]
====
One automation script per file.
====

.This is how a valid automation script looks like:
[source,js]
----
{
  // A short label describing this script
  label: '...',

  // A longer description of what it does. Don\'t go over board.
  description: '...',

  // This controls script-level security, such as the invoking user.
  // We cover some details a bit later.
  security: {...},

  // This function returns a list of triggers that specify when the script should be ran.
  // We cover some details a bit later.
  triggers: (t) {...},

  // This is the code that is ran when the script is executed.
  // We cover some details a bit later.
  exec: (args, ctx) {...};
}
----

.You can use this template to cover most cases:

[NOTE]
====
See xref:automation-scripts/samples/server-scripts/index.adoc[server script samples], and xref:automation-scripts/samples/client-scripts/index.adoc[client script samples] for more.
====

[#automation-trigger]
== Automation triggers

Automation triggers (triggers) control when a specific automation script is executed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automation triggers are evaluated in an isolated context that doesn't allow any external data (variables or imports).

.This will not work:
[source,js]
----
const MOD_NAME = 'Contact'

export default {
  triggers ({ on }) {
    return on('manual')
      .for(MOD_NAME) // ðŸ‘ˆ we're referencing the constant here
  },
  exec (args, ctx) {...},
}
----
====

.The three main bits of a trigger:
. an event specifies what system events this trigger will react to,
. a <<trigger-define-resource,resource>> specifies what system resource the trigger will react for,
. a <<trigger-define-constraint,constraint>> specifies how the event needs to look like in order for the trigger to react.

.Available trigger types:
[cols="1a,5a"]
|===
| [#trigger-type-explicit]#<<trigger-type-explicit,Explicit>>#
| These are *explicitly triggered* by pressing a *button*.

Use explicit triggers when you wish to *manually initiate something*, such as an OAuth authentication flow, redirection to an external resource, or data export.

| [#trigger-type-implicit]#<<trigger-type-implicit,Implicit>>#
| These are *implicitly triggered* based on *system events*.

Use implicit triggers when you wish to *automatically do something* when another thing occurs; such as sending an email when you register a new user; or adding a changelog entry when the content changes.

Refer to xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/resource-events-reference.adoc[resources and events] for a complete list of events you can listen for.

| [#trigger-type-deferred]#<<trigger-type-deferred,Deferred>>#

_Server script only_, _requires explicit security context_
| The system triggers these *sometime in the future*; either *periodically* (define with *cron expressions*), or *at a timestamp* (use *ISO 8601*; this one: `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`).

A sample for an xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/samples/triggers/index.adoc#sample-trigger-deferred-interval[interval], and a xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/samples/triggers/index.adoc#sample-trigger-deferred-timestamp[timestamp].

Use deferred triggers when you want to *repeat something* or *do something in the future*; such as recurring payments or sending holiday newsletters to your subscribers.

[NOTE]
====
The scheduler acts *once per minute*, so that is the maximum accuracy {PRODUCT_NAME} supports.
====

| [#trigger-type-sink]#<<trigger-type-sink,Sink>>#

_Server script only_, _requires explicit security context_
| These are triggered by the system *when it receives a request*; either *HTTP*, or *email*.

Use sink triggers when you want to *respond to requests*; such as *webhooks for external services* or *custom API endpoints*.
For example *capturing data from external forms*, *tracking external document changes*, and *capturing payments*.

[NOTE]
====
We recommend you use the *REST API* whenever possible.
====

[#trigger-define-resource]
=== Define a resource

To define what resource the trigger should react for (such as module, user, role), we use the conveniently named `.for('resource:goes:here')` method.

.An example of specifying a resource:
[source,js]
----
triggers ({ before }) {
  return before('create', 'update')
    // This will trigger for a compose record resource
    .for('compose:record')
},
----

Refer to xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/resource-events-reference.adoc[resources and events] for a complete list of available resources and supported events.

[#trigger-define-constraint]
=== Define a constraint

[NOTE]
====
Refer to xref:ROOT:integrator-guide/resource-constraints.adoc[resource constraints] for a list of available constraint properties for each resource.
====

To define how an event needs to look like (such as the module name, user email, role handle), we use the `.where(property, operator, value)` method, or a variation of it.

.Let me explain:
* When you provide two arguments to the method, the first one specifies the *property* and the second one specifies the *value*.
The default <<constraint-operator-eq,equality operator>> is used.
* When you specify three arguments to the method, the first one specifies the *property*, the second one specifies the <<trigger-comparison-operators,comparison *operator*>> and the third one specifies the *value*.

.An example of chaining constraints:
[source,js]
----
triggers ({ before }) {
  return before('create', 'update')
    .for('compose:record')
    .where('module', 'Lead')
    .where('namespace', 'crm')
},
----

[#trigger-comparison-operators]
.Available comparison operators:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#constraint-operator-eq]#<<constraint-operator-eq,Equals (default)>>#
|
* `eq`
* `=`
* `==`
* `===`

| [#constraint-operator-neq]#<<constraint-operator-neq,Not equals>>#
|
* `not eq`
* `ne`
* `!=`
* `!==`

| [#constraint-operator-prt]#<<constraint-operator-prt,Partial equals>>#
|
* `like`

[TIP]
====
.Supported wildcards:
* *one or more characters*: `%`, `*`,
* *one character*: `_`, `?`.
====

| [#constraint-operator-nprt]#<<constraint-operator-nprt,Partial not equals>>#
|
* `not like`

[TIP]
====
.Supported wildcards:
* *one or more characters*: `%`, `*`,
* *one character*: `_`, `?`.
====

| [#constraint-operator-regex]#<<constraint-operator-regex,Regex equals>>#
|
* `~`

| [#constraint-operator-nregex]#<<constraint-operator-nregex,Regex not equals>>#
|
* `!~`

|===

=== Conventions

.Available comparison operators:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#trigger-destructuring]#<<trigger-destructuring,Use object destructuring>>#
|
Object destructuring helps you shorten the entire thing.

.For example:
[source,js]
----
// Instead of using:
triggers (t) {
  return t.after('create')
    .for('compose:record')
    .where('module', 'super_secret_module')
},

// you can do:
triggers ({ after }) { // ðŸ‘ˆ this thing
  return after('create')
    .for('compose:record')
    .where('module', 'super_secret_module')
},
----

Neat, right?!

| [#constrained-constraints]#<<constrained-constraints,Use constraints>>#
|
Loose constraints can lead to unwanted side effects such as running the script when a record in a different namespace is created.

.For example:
[source,js]
----
// Instead of using:
triggers (t) {
  return t.after('create')
    .for('compose:record')
    .where('module', 'super_secret_module')
},

// you should do:
triggers ({ after }) {
  return after('create')
    .for('compose:record')
    .where('module', 'super_secret_module')
    .where('namespace', 'super_secret_namespace') // ðŸ‘ˆ this thing
},
----


|===

== Security context

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automation scripts are no exception to the access control system.
====

The security context lets you control who can invoke the automation script as well as what access the script should have.

[#involing-user]
=== Invoking user

[IMPORTANT]
====
*Deferred* and *sink* scripts require you to specify the security context as the invoker is not known.
====

The invoking user is someone who performed an action that triggered the script execution.
For example; you pressed a button, so you are the invoking user.

By specifying the invoking user, the automation script may access some resources that the actual invoking user may not have access to, such as personal client information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is only available for server-scripts.
====


.An example of defining an invoking user:
[source,js]
----
export default {
  trigger (t) {...}

  security: 'some-user-identifier-here',

  exec (args, ctx) {...}
}
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can use the user's handle, email or ID as the user identifier.
We suggest you use an email or handle.
====

[TIP]
====
A good practice is to create a new system user that is dedicated for script execution wherever you need this.
====

=== Allowing and denying script execution

Security context lets you prevent specific users from performing specific operations.
For example, you can prevent regular users from signing documents or sending quotes.

.Use these properties when defining the context:
* `allow` specifies what *roles are permitted to trigger* the automation script.
* `deny` specifies what *roles are not allowed to trigger* the automation script.

[IMPORTANT]
====
*DevNote* fact-check this bit.

This is only available for explicit scripts (buttons).
====

.An example of permitting access:
[source,js]
----
export default {
  trigger (t) {...}

  security: {
    allow: ['administrator', 'superuser'],
  },

  exec (args, ctx) {...}
}
----

.An example of denying access:
[source,js]
----
export default {
  trigger (t) {...}

  security: {
    deny: ['client', 'lead'],
  },

  exec (args, ctx) {...}
}
----

.The above `package.json` defines three scripts:
* `lint` lints the code using the default ES6 standard (can be configured; see https://eslint.org/docs/rules/[here]),
* `test:unit` runs your unit tests defined inside `.test.js` files (can be configured in the `.mocharc.js` file),
* `test:unit:cc` runs your unit tests with code coverage.

[NOTE]
====
The code coverage report gets generated into the `coverage` directory.
Inspect the `coverage/lcov-report` directory for a HTML report.

I usually use the https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server[http-server] package to help with this, but a simple "Open in <browser name here>" will do.
