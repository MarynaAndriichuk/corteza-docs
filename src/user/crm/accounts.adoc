= Accounts

In accounts you store information about your customers.
Accounts are companies that you’re doing business with, and contacts are the people who work in them.

An account can have multiple contacts, and by default the lead that was converted in to an account + contact in the Leads module is set as “Primary contact for account”.
This means that the data of this contact will be used for Quote generation.

The modules related to accounts are:

* Contacts
* Opportunities
* Entitlements
* Contracts
* Cases
* Tasks
* Events
* Related events
* Notes

The most important action in an account is creating opportunities.
This can be done easily with the automation button “Generate new opportunity”, which maps all relevant account data directly to the new opportunity.
