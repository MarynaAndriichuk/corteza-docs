= Corteza Query Language

Corteza uses SQL-like query language for basic filtering and sorting records.

Corteza QL allows you to filter records by their values.

In the following example we have module with 2 numeric fields `quantity` and `price`, string field `name` and boolean field `visible`:

To query for records with zero quantity or zero price:

====
quantity = 0 or price = zero
====

To query all visible records starting with the letter "a"

====
visible AND name LIKE 'a%'
====

To order records, descending by price and ascending by quantity:
====
price DESC, quantity
====


== Supported filtering operators:

.Comparison operators
|===
| `=`       | Equal
| `!=`      | Not equal
| `<>`      | Not equal
| `<`       | Less
| `\<=`     | Less or equal
| `>`       | Greater
| `>=`      | Greater or equal
| `LIKE`    | Matches the pattern (`"example%`)
| `NOT LIKE`| Does not match the pattern (`"example%`)
|===

.Arithmetic operators
|===
| `+`       | Addition
| `-`       | Subtraction
| `*`       | Multiplication
| `/`       | Division
|===

.Boolean operators
|===
| `AND`     | True when left and right are true
| `OR`      | True when left or right are true
|===

== Supported sorting operators:

|===
| `,`        | Delimiter between sorting expressions or columns
| `ASC`      | Sort by expression or column in ascending order, lower values first (null/missing values are first)
| `DESC`     | Sort by expression or column in ascending order, lower values last (null/missing values are last)
|===


== Limited set of supported date-operation functions:

|===
| `QUARTER`     | Returns quarter from the given date/datetime
| `YEAR`        | Returns year from the given date/datetime
| `DATE_FORMAT` | Returns formatted date the given date/datetime
| `DATE`        | Returns date from the given datetime
|===


== Plans for the future
. Improved filtering, similar to MongoDB query filters. This will allow more flexibility and safer execution.
