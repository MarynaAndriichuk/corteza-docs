== Where to start

Get familiar with git superpowers!
Get to know about rebase, interactive rebase, cherry-picking, fast-forward merging and using reflog.
Learn how to stash, squash and hard reset to mold your commits into a perfectly written story.

Just looking around?
It's best if you do that on the last stable release.

Fixing a bug?
Try to find out the version where that bug is causing issues and start there

Working on a new feature?
Start with the "bleeding-edge" and checkout branch where the next release is getting ready.
