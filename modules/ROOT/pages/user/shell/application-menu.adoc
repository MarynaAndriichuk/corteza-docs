= Application Menu

The Application Menu lists the applications available to you as a user to open.
It is accessed by clicking on a plus sign (+) at the end of open <<Tabs>>.

When the cursor is “rolled over” any application, the user is presented with two options:

- Open in **{PRODUCT_NAME} Tab** which opens the application in the {APP_NAME_SHELL} workspace.
- Open in **New Window** which opens the application in an external browser window.

Once you have selected the first of the two options, you will be redirected automatically to the main {APP_NAME_SHELL} interface with application you have selected open in the Tab.
