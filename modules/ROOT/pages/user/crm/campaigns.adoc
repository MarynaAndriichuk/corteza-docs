= Campaigns

A campaign is a marketing project that you want to plan, manage, and track within the CRM.
It can be a newsletter, seminar, conference, or other type of marketing initiative.

Campaign members are leads or contacts that entered the CRM via that campaign, and the opportunities related to them are generated opportunities.
These opportunities allow you to check the ROI of the campaign, when you compare the costs to the value won in opportunities.
